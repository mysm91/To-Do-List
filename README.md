# To-Do-App

## Kaaryar Institute's Front End Advanced Course project

Need a powerful to-do app? This one's got you covered! Effortlessly add, edit, and delete tasks, and mark them as done or undone with ease. Take control of your life with this amazing app!

Getting started:

```bash
install the JSON server using the "npm install" command

to run the JSON server you can command
"npm start"
or
json-server --watch data/db.json --port 3000
```

## Please take note of the following recommendations:

> It is advisable to avoid using "live server" as it may cause conflicts with json-server.
> We suggest using "Preview on Web Server" instead, which can provide a smoother experience.
